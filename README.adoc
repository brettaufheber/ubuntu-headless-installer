=== Usage

==== Command

[source]
----
sudo ubuntu-installer.sh install-system \
  -u <your username> \
  -n <hostname> \
  -c <Ubuntu codename: bionic|cosmic|...> \
  -b <optional software bundles: desktop,dev,...> \
  -x <block device file for system partition '/': /dev/...> \
  -y <block device file for home partition '/home': /dev/...>
----

==== Dependencies

The installer depends on "debootstrap".

[source]
----
sudo apt-get install debootstrap
----

==== Partitioning and Formatting

* Partitioning must be done before installation because the installer requires the system partition and home partition
as block device files.
* The block device file for the system partition must be unmounted before starting the installer.
* The system partition is formatted during installation.
* The home partition is *not* formatted during installation to prevent data loss and must be formatted manually before
installation.

==== Software bundles

* virt: QEMU/KVM with extended tooling
* dev: basic equipment for software developers
* desktop: minimal GNOME desktop
* laptop: power saving tools for mobile devices
* web: server and proxy for web
* x86: architecture specific tools and libraries (requires dev)
